**Your answer:**
We can see from the graph we got that increasing ```k``` didn't lead to improved generalization for unseen data.
This is an example of the bias-variance tradeoff. Low values of ```k``` yield in classifiers that are more commited to memory
and therefore overfit. High values underfit. Therefore, the middle values are the best.
